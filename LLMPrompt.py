entity_discovery_prompt = """
You are expertise in knowledge graph schema design and relational database design.
You have extensive experience in extracting entities and their properties from structured data to design efficient and meaningful knowledge graphs. 
You are provided with tables schemas and discover key entities together with their relevant properties. 

Instructions:
1. Identify unique entities from the given table(s).
An entity is a unique concept such as Airport, Player_Name, Flight_Number, Airline
2. Assign related properties to each entity that define it.
3. Use the exact column name give as property name and do not rename columns
4. An entity can be derived from multiple tables, and a table can contain multiple entities.
5. Do not add same property to more than one entity

Output: Return the result strictly in JSON format as an array where each object has:
1. entity
2. property
3. is_key_property
4. source_table
5. source_column

Example:

{
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity": "Airport",
      "property": "id",
      "is_key_property": true,
      "source_table": "airport",
      "source_column": "id"
    },
    {
      "entity": "Airport",
      "property": "City",
      "is_key_property": false,
      "source_table": "airport",
      "source_column": "City"
    },
    {
      "entity": "Airport",
      "property": "Country",
      "is_key_property": false,
      "source_table": "airport",
      "source_column": "Country"
    }
    ]

You are an experience data modeller and specialize in both knowledge graph design and relational database design.
You have experience across many industries and have domain knowledge about those industries. 
You are given tables schemas and entity configurations. 
You able to identify the relationships in the graph database are structured, relevant, non-redundant and avoiding generic or unnecessary links. 

Given table schemas and entity creation configurations, discover the relationships between entities to establish a knowledge graphs.

Ways to discover relationships:
1. Create relationship only if there are meaningful connection according to domain.
2. Avoid generic relationships such as "relate to", "has", "have" and etc.
3. Derive relationships from same table if key properties of the entities that users are likely to ask about
4. Derive relationships from same table if key properties of the entities are presents as columns in that table
5. If key properties of connecting entities exist in different tables, check if common column can be used for joining and establish relationship. 
6. Ensure correct relationship direction such as "player Plays match", "airport LOCATED_AT perth", "student ENROLLED units".
7. The relationships identified should be meaningful and useful for users to get answer query
8. Avoid duplicate relationships such as student TEACHED_BY teacher, and teacher TEACHED student


Output: Return the result strictly in JSON format as an array where each object has:
1. Source_Entity
2. Relationship
3. Target_Entity
4. Source_Property
5. Target_Property
6. Source_Table
7. Target_Table
8. Source_Column
9. Target_Column
10. Joining_Condition (if applicable)

Example:
{ "relationships" :[{
"Source_Entity": "Flight",
"Relationship": "OPERATED_BY",
"Target_Entity": "Operate_Company",
"Source_Property": "company_id",
"Target_Property": "id",
"Source_Table": "flight",
"Target_Table": "operate_company",
"Source_Column": "company_id",
"Target_Column": "id",
"Joining_Condition": "flight.company_id = operate_company.id"},
{
"Source_Entity": "Flight",
"Relationship": "DEPARTS_FROM",

"""

 
graph_entity_prompt = """
You are an expert in knowledge graph design and relational database modeling. 
You are provided with the schema of a relational database. 
Your task is to discover a complete knowledge graph representation from it

You will be given the relational database schema with 2 keys, "tables" and "foreign_keys".
In the tables, you will have multiple tables. In each table, you will have multiple columns. 
The foreign_keys will have the information about the parent table and from table and their respective columns name

Example as below:
{
"tables":{table1:{columns:[column_1,column_2,...],"primary_key":[primary_keys]}, {table2:{columns:[column_1,column_2,....],"primary_key":[primary_keys]}},....,},
"foreign_keys":[{"from_table":from_table_name,"parent_table":parent_table_name,"from_column":from_column_name,"parent_column":parent_column_name},{"from_table":from_table_name,"parent_table":parent_table_name,"from_column":from_column_name,"parent_column":parent_column_name},....]
}


Instructions:
1. Discover entities / nodes in graph:
Your task is to identify meaningful entities such as Airport, Flight, Company from the given schema.
For each identified entity, you will identify key property and list all relevant properties which you can extract from the columns name.
You will NOT duplicate properties across multiple entities.
Consider to merge properties if multiple tables states the same property or properties.
You will use the exact column name as properties. Do not rename them. 

2. Discover relationships / edges in graph:
Your task is to identify meaningful and non-generic relationships between entities such as flight DEPARTS_FROM airport, player PLAYS match, teacher TEACHES student.
You can derive the relationship explicitly from foreign key or multiple foreign keys in the schema given which is/are join tables.  
Make sure the direction of the relationship is sensible such as flight DEPARTS_FROM airport, company OPERATES airline, doctor PROVIDE prescription
You should make sure the relationship is unique and prevent duplicated relationship such as teacher TEACHES student and student TEACHED_BY teacher are duplicated

Output format required:

Return a single JSON object that contains 2 keys:

1. "Nodes": An array of entities. Each object must contain the following
"id"(string): Entity Name (Example: Flight,Company, Employee, Employer, University)
"Properties" (List of String): Usually is columns in relational database / property names
"key" (String): Primary key of relational database
Example of nodes:
"id": Employee, "Properties": [employee_id, employee_name, Birth of Date, start_date], "key": employee_id
"id": Company, "Properties":[company_id, company_name], "key": company_id


2. "Edges": An array of relationships. Each object must contain the following:
"source" (String): Source Entity Name such as flight
"target" (String): Target Entity Name such as airport
"relationship" (String): Relationship name/ type of relationship such as departs_from
"source_column" (String): column name in source table. Do not rename the column name, use the column name in source table
"target_column" (String): Column name in target table. Do not rename the column name, use the column name in target table 
Example of edges: 
source: Flight, target: Airport, relationship: Departs_from, source_column: airport_id, target_column: id
source: Student, target: Study_Units, relationship: Enrolled, source_column: unit_id, target_column: id

Output Example:

{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "Airport",
      "properties": ["id", "City", "Country", "IATA", "ICAO", "name"],
